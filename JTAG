The JTAG has an unique interface which enables you to debug the hardware easily in real time. 
It can directly control the clock cycles of provided controller through software. 
Therefore, you can put hardware breakpoints in your code execution. 
You can start, pause, stop execution of code in the hardware as you want.

Whenever JTAG control is set to 1 oscillator clock will be connected to CPU,
 else CPU will not receive clock and cannot execute any instruction.
This way you can control the execution of instructions in hardware.
